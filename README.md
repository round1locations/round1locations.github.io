### How to Contribute

1. Go to `_data/r1index.csv` in this repo's files, and click the Edit button (the pencil icon in the top right). Now you can edit the table data in plaintext right in your browser.
2. Most of the columns are self-explanatory, just follow the rest of the rows for example.
    * Keep the rows in alphabetical order by shop code.
    * For the `ziv` column, copy the arcade's ID from the Zenius-i-Vanisher arcade page url (the number after `arcade.php?id=`).
    * If the arcade has no ZiV page, that's okay, just leave it blank, but make sure there is still a comma following the `state` column.
3. When you are finished, submit your changes in a pull request. Once your changes are accepted by a project maintainer, github will automatically update & publish the Pages site within a few minutes.
